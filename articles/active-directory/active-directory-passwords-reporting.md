# Reporting options for Azure AD password management

Post deployment many organizations want to know how or if SSPR is really being used. Azure AD provides reporting features that help you to answer questions using canned reports and if you are appropriately licensed, allow you to create custom queries.

![Reporting][Reporting]

The following questions can be answered by reports that exist in the [Azure portal] (https://portal.azure.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> You must be [a global administrator](active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal.md) and must opt-in for this data to be gathered on behalf of your organization, by visiting the reporting tab or audit logs at least once. Until doing so, data will not be collected for your organization

* How many people have registered for password reset?
* Who has registered for password reset?
* What data are people registering?
* How many people reset their passwords in the last seven days?
* What are the most common methods users or admins use to reset their passwords?
* What are common issues users or admins face when attempting to use password reset?
* What admins are resetting their own passwords frequently?
* Is there any suspicious activity going on with password reset?

## Power BI content pack

If you are a Power BI user there is a content pack for Azure AD that includes easy to use reporting for SSPR. Find more info on how to use and deploy the content pack in the article [How to use the Azure Active Directory Power BI Content Pack](active-directory-reporting-power-bi-content-pack-how-to.md). You can then create your own dashboards and share them with others in your organization.

## How to view password management reports in the Azure portal

In the Azure portal experience, we have an improved way to view password reset and password reset registration activity.  Follow the steps below to find the password reset and password reset registration events:

1. Navigate to [**portal.azure.com**](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click the **More services** menu on the main Azure portal left-hand navigation
3. Search for **Azure Active Directory** in the list of services and select it
4. Click **Users & Groups** from the Azure Active Directory navigation menu
5. Click the **Audit Logs** navigation item from the Users & Groups navigation menu. This shows you all of the audit events occurring against all the users in your directory. You can filter this view to see all the password-related events, as well.
6. To filter this view to only the password reset related events, click the **Filter** button at the top of the blade.
7. From the **Filter** menu, select the **Category** dropdown, and change it to the **Self-service Password Management** category type.
8. Optionally further filter the list by choosing the specific **Activity** you are interested

## How to retrieve password management events from the Azure AD Reports and Events API

The Azure AD Reports and Events API supports retrieving all the information included in password reset and password reset registration reports. By using this API, you can download individual password reset and password reset registration events for integration with the reporting technology of your choice.

### How to get started with the reporting API

To access this data, you need to write a small app or script to retrieve it from our servers. [Learn how to get started with the Azure AD Reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started.md).

Once you have a working script, you'll next want to examine the password reset and registration events that you can retrieve to meet your scenarios.

* [SsprActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset events
* [SsprRegistrationActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprRegistrationActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset registration events

### Reporting API data retrieval limitations

Currently, the Azure AD Reports and Events API retrieves up to **75,000 individual events** of the [SsprActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprActivityEvent) and [SsprRegistrationActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprRegistrationActivityEvent) types, spanning the **last 30 days**.

If you need to retrieve or store data beyond this window, we suggest persisting it in an external database and using the API to query the deltas that result. Our recommendation is to begin retrieving this data when you start using SSPR in your organization, persist it externally, and then continue to track the deltas from this point forward.

## Description of report columns in Azure portal

The following list explains each of the report columns in detail:

* **User** – the user who attempted a password reset registration operation.
* **Role** – the role of the user in the directory.
* **Date and Time** – the date and time of the attempt.
* **Data Registered** – what authentication data the user provided during password reset registration.

## Description of report values in Azure portal

The following table describes the different values allowed for each column:

| Column | Allowed values and their meanings |
| --- | --- |
| Data Registered |**Alternate Email** – user used alternate email or authentication email to authenticate<p><p>**Office Phone**– user used office phone to authenticate<p>**Mobile Phone** - user used mobile phone or authentication phone to authenticate<p>**Security Questions** – user used security questions to authenticate<p>**Any combination of the above (for example, Alternate Email + Mobile Phone)** – occurs when a 2 gate policy is specified and shows which two methods the user used to authentication their password reset request. |

## Self-service Password Management activity types
